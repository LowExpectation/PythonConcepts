# PA12- Employee Data

# Reminder: When prompting the user,
# you must always include text which lets
# the user know what should be inputted.

# Project details:

# Create a Employee class with four instance attributes:

#     emp_number as an int
#     name as a string
#     department as a string
#     yearly_salary as an int

# The class should include an __init__() method to initialize
# an Employee object and a __str__() method to describe an
# initialized Employee object. The class should include two instance methods:

# one called update_department(),
# which takes a string as an argument
# and updates the employee's department attribute
# one called update_salary(), which takes an int as an argument
# and updates the employee's salary attribute.

# After the Employee class code,
# prompt the user to enter the
# emp_number, name, department and salary.
# Instantiate an Employee object by passing
# in the user's input as the arguments and print out the Employee's
# attributes by calling the __str__() method.
# No prompting for input should be included in the Employee class.

# Test the update_department() and update_salary() methods
# by calling both methods and passing in a new
# department and salary for the Employee object that you created.
# Call the __str__() to display the updated Employee's information.

# Save the program in a file named employee.py
# and attach the employee.py file to this assignment.
# Add the required comments to top of your .py file:
# You must include comments in your code following industry standards.
# Not including comments in your code or random comments that do not
# pertain to your code will result in points being deducted.
