# PythonPractice

This repository is just a listing of Python practices I have completed in my personal time.
I have many more but sharing my personal batch scripts isnt going to be helpful for anyone.

Feel free to browse or even suggest changes, I will keep refactoring as I get time.
My work does not allow posting to GitHub repositories so the majority of my work is locked behind corporate security policies.
